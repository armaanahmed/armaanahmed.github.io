### thanks for checking my website out! here's a little about myself:

After pursuing a bachelor's degree in Neural Science at New York University, am now pursuing graduate studies at Columbia University, where my research focuses on data science and computational biology. Here, I work at Richard Axel's Lab, where I'm assisting postdoctoral researcher Evan Schaffer in his research on the spatial and temporal structure of neural activity across the fly brain.
