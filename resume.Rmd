### thanks for checking my website out! here's a little about myself:

After pursuing a bachelor's degree in Neural Science at New York University, I 
I decided to attend Columbia University to pursue graduate studies in Data Science
and Computational Biology. Here, I work at Richard Axel's Lab, where I'm assisting
Evan Schaffer in research on the spatial and temporal structure of neural activity
across the fly brain.
